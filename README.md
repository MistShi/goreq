# goreq
A Simplified Http Client.
Its initial codes are cloned from [HttpRequest](https://github.com/parnurzeal/gorequest).
I have refactored the codes and make it more friendly to programmers. 
And some bugs are fixed and new features are added.

Major changes include:
* can send any string or bytes in body 
* can set a shared client for concurrency
* won't clear setting actively
* ......

You can see the release notes for details.
